# Open Policy Registry (OPCR) Slack Guidelines

The [CNCF Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
applies in all areas in addition to these rules:

## Channel Spamming

Outside of the issue queues, Slack is our best communication medium for
projects. Please keep your messages on topic for each channel, and please use
the appropriate channel. Please do not cross-post. Spamming channels with
unsolicited or frequent messages is not allowed.

## Vendor Advertisements

This workspace is intended for conversations related to OPCR 
projects. Please do not use the Slack to advertise proprietary vendor products,
services, webinars, blogs, etc.

## Reporting a Problem

Please report issues to Vlad Iovanov (vlad@aserto.com or @viovanov) or Gert 
Drapers (gert@aserto.com).

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. If a
community member engages in unacceptable behavior, an admin may take any action
deemed appropriate, up to and including a warning or temporary 30 day ban, along
with a permanent ban for repeated violation of these guidelines. Admins may also
remove content that violates the above guidelines.
